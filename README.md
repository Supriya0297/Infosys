# 🏨 AI-Powered Guest Experience Personalization System

This project aims to revolutionize the hospitality industry by using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to analyze guest feedback, monitor sentiment trends, and personalize recommendations. The system dynamically enhances guest satisfaction by providing real-time alerts to service teams.

## 📌 Features

- **Guest Feedback Analysis**: Extracts and interprets guest feedback to identify preferences and sentiment.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers tailored activity and amenity suggestions based on guest profiles.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications to service teams for immediate action.
- **Sentiment Monitoring**: Tracks and visualizes sentiment trends to improve customer experiences.
- **Scalable & Modular**: Designed for easy integration with existing hotel management systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for user dashboards and reports)
- **Backend**: Python (data extraction and sentiment analysis)
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA
- **Database**: MongoDB (for guest information and feedback storage)
- **APIs**: RESTful API for seamless communication

## 📊 System Workflow

1. Collect guest feedback via multiple channels (surveys, reviews, etc.).
2. Analyze text using **LLMs** for sentiment and entity recognition.
3. Store processed data and sentiment insights in **MongoDB**.
4. Generate personalized recommendations based on historical patterns.
5. Trigger real-time alerts for service improvement based on sentiment.

## 📈 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Supriya0297/Infosys.git
   ```

2. Set up the backend environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the database (MongoDB):
   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and update `.env` with your database credentials.

4. Run the backend and Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
